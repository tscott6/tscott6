### Hello Everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm Thomas Scott, a University of Calgary Software Engineering MEng student. As part of a 16-month transitory program, I am learning full-stack development with significant work in Java, Python, C/C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ReactJS), SQL, and PySpark. My interests are anything and everything to do with software design, with a particular eye towards full-stack applications and video games (especially the strategy kind). Coming from a Chemical Engineering degree I also have a passion for process topics and am always looking for chances to leverage my industry knowledge with my software skills.
